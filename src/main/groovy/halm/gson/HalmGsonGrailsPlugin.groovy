    def description = '''\
This plugin functionally replaces the standard extension of the GSON view for HAL support.
It allows to make GSON view file looks more like final HAL document and at the same time 
minimize amount of code developer must write. Also it makes sure unlike built-in GSON extension
that resulting document will be valid HAL document.

Finally by coping the code of the GSON view file (without model definition part) into Controller
developer can debug the view line-by-line to find and squash all bugs in it.
